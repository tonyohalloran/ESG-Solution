# AI ESG Report Builder

Welcome to the AI ESG Report Builder repository! This project showcases the power of AI-ready data management by automating and enhancing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting. The solution leverages a combination of data from gather360, natural language processing with OpenAI's GPT, and Streamlit for an interactive user interface.

## Context and Background

### About the Project

The AI ESG Report Builder tool is designed to simplify and improve the generation of ESG reports. ESG reporting is critical for companies to assess and communicate their impact on environmental, social, and governance factors. Traditionally, creating these reports is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Our solution automates this process, saving time and ensuring accuracy and consistency.

### Inspiration and Development

I’m Tony, the Applied AI Lead at a stealth startup in Dublin. Our mission is to make AI more robust and trustworthy by leveraging a unique data supply chain platform. 


### Our Mission
I work at a mission-driven company.
We believe that data is key to successful AI business implementation.
The current state of business data consistently falls short of what AI needs to deliver its full potential. This gap is where our data supply chain comes into play. We aim to create a consistent, reliable interface for accessing and utilising data, ensuring it is enriched with context, history, provenance, and attribution. This approach transforms data into a powerful asset that AI can leverage with confidence and trustworthiness.

### The Thesis
Our thesis is simple yet profound: The right data unlocks AI's potential. By providing AI with well-structured, contextualised data, we can enable organisations to deploy AI solutions that are not only effective but also transparent and verifiable. This leads to better decision-making, optimised operations, and greater success. We want to democratise AI by making it easier for organisations without deep AI expertise to realise its benefits.

## Key Features

1. **Data Integration**: Connects to gather360 to fetch survey data.
2. **Data Processing**: Processes survey data to generate detailed reports.
3. **AI-Powered Reporting**: Uses OpenAI's GPT to create comprehensive ESG reports.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction and report generation.

## How It Works

### Data Flow

1. **Input Credentials**: Users input their gather360 and OpenAI credentials via the Streamlit sidebar.
2. **Fetch Data**: The app fetches survey data from gather360.
3. **Process Data**: Processes the data according to predefined mappings of questions and answers.
4. **Generate Report**: Uses OpenAI's GPT to generate a detailed ESG report, comparing selected company data with cohort data.
5. **Download Report**: Users can download the generated report in Markdown format.

### Main Components

- **Streamlit Interface**: For user input and report generation.
- **gather360 Connector**: For fetching survey data.
- **Data Processing Functions**: To handle and process survey responses.
- **OpenAI Integration**: For generating narrative reports based on processed data.
